                <p>Our Bakery is an American-style pastry kitchen established in 2004 to bring the bona fide taste of American home heating to New York. The organization opened its first branch on Portobello Road in Notting Hill in 2007 and has since propelled
                    a further six branches crosswise over New York and Surrey in South Kensington, Soho, Spitalfields, Islington and Richmond.</p>

            </h1>
            <br>
            <p>Our Bakery primarily produces and sells flour-based food baked in oven such as breads, cookies, cakes, pastries, and pies. Also served and delievers coffee and tea to customers. Confectionery items are also made in our bakery.
            </p>
            <p>One of the key factors in our Bakery’s prosperity has been its ethos that cakes taste best when they’ve been naturally heated utilizing the very same fixings and methods as those utilized in home preparing. Consequently, every single Bakery
                branch has its own kitchen and a group of occupant master pastry specialists and cake decorators.</p>
            <p>We offer our clients a full scope of breads, forte breads, morning merchandise, cakes and baked goods. Our bread is heated day by day at our pastry shop in East Horsley and is conveyed to our twelve shops. We utilize profoundly gifted specialty
                dough punchers to guarantee each portion of bread is flawless without fail. Our pastry specialists work during that time with the goal that the portion of bread you purchase toward the beginning of the day is crisp out of the stove!</p>

                <li>Our chefs work in a diverse array of kitchen and culinary environments.</li>
                <li>Day-to-day operations can also require the pastry chef to research recipe concepts and develop and test new recipes. Usually the pastry chef does all the necessary preparation of the various desserts in advance, before dinner seating begins.
                    The actual plating of the desserts is often done by another station chef, usually the garde manger, at the time of order. The pastry chef is often in charge of the dessert menu, which besides traditional desserts, may include dessert
                    wines, specialty dessert beverages, and gourmet cheese platters.</li>
                <li>Pastry chefs are also expected to fully understand their ingredients and the chemical reactions that occur when making fine pastries. Precise timing and temperatures are critically important.</li>
                <li>It is generally preferred to weigh the ingredients as opposed to measuring by cup, as weighing offers far more consistent baking results. In larger kitchens, the pastry chef may have a number of other chefs working in their station, each
                    responsible for specific types of pastries:</li>
